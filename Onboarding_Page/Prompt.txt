Create a complete Google Apps Script project for a "M-Swasth Doctor Registration Form". The project must contain two files: code.gs for the backend and index.html for the frontend.
Frontend (index.html) Requirements:
Styling: The form should be visually appealing and responsive. Use the 'Poppins' Google Font. The page background should be a blue linear-gradient (#2193b0 to #6dd5ed) with an animated, floating particle effect using particles.js. The main form container should be white, centered, with rounded corners and a subtle box-shadow, and have a gentle floating animation. Required fields must be marked with a red asterisk.
Form Structure: The form must be divided into the following sections with the exact fields listed:
Basic Details (Required): Employee Code, Doctor Name, First Name, Middle Name (optional), Last Name, Father's Name, Gender (dropdown), Date of Birth, Date of Joining, Aadhar Number (12-digit pattern), PAN Number, Languages Known.
Contact Details (Required): Email, Mobile No (10-digit pattern).
Employment Details (Optional): ID Number, Department, Designation, Shift Timings, Type of Job (dropdown: Part Time/Full Time), Previous Work Experience.
Bank Details (Required): Bank Name, Bank Account Number, IFSC Code.
Address Details (Required): Present Address (textarea), Present City, Present Pin Code, Permanent Address (textarea), Permanent City, Permanent Pin Code.
Personal Details (Required): Marital Status (dropdown), Blood Group, Total Work Experience, Nationality.
Physical Status (Required & Conditional): This must be a dropdown with two options: "Not Applicable" and "Person with Disability (PwD)". If "PwD" is selected, a new file upload input for a "Disability Certificate" must appear and become a required field. If the selection is changed back, it must disappear.
Qualification & Certification (Required): Qualification (text), Permanent Medical Registration Certificate Number, Medical Council Board Name. This section must also contain three required file uploads: "Qualification Certificate", "Medical Registration Certificate", and "Signature Copy".
General Uploads (Required): Aadhaar Card, PAN Card, Recent Picture, Passbook / Cancelled Cheque, and an optional "Other Documents" input that allows for multiple file selection.
JavaScript Logic:
Write a JavaScript handleSubmit function that triggers on form submission.
This function must prevent the default submission, show a "loading..." message, and disable the submit button.
It must read all uploaded files (including the conditional disability certificate and multiple "other" documents) and asynchronously convert them to Base64 strings.
It must use google.script.run with .withSuccessHandler() and .withFailureHandler() to call the backend processForm function. On success, it should alert the user and reset the form.
Backend (code.gs) Requirements:
doGet(): A standard doGet() function to serve the Index.html file.
processForm() function: This function must accept arguments for every single field and file from the index.html form, in the correct order.
Google Sheets Integration:
The function must open a specific Google Sheet by its ID.
It must append a new row containing a timestamp and all the submitted text-based form data.
If the target sheet name ("Registrations") doesn't exist, the script must create it and add a header row with titles for all the data columns.
Google Drive Integration:
The function must access a specific parent folder in Google Drive by its ID.
It must create a new subfolder for each submission, named dynamically in the format [Doctor Name]_[Employee Code]_Docs.
It must decode all the Base64 file strings received from the frontend and save each one as a file (e.g., adhar.pdf, signature.png) inside the newly created doctor-specific folder.
Return Value: The function should return a success message string (e.g., "Doctor data and files saved successfully!") or an error message if an exception occurs.
Ensure the code is clean, well-commented, and robust.
